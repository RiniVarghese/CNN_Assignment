## General Information
Problem Statement:

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis

Business Goal:
Goal is to build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow
